\section{Project Details}
Your project should involve the use of machine learning to conduct an analysis for a health care problem. The proposal is due on March 22nd.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this project proposal is to generate a proposal for your course project. It should be concise and describe the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item Construction and description of a research framework that motivates the need for machine learning for your health-related task
\item Proposal for machine learning techniques appropriate for the problem
\item Description of the data
\item Description of possible limitations of the study
\item Description of the impact of likely analysis outcomes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameters}
The project is intended to be conducted in pairs, with one person taking the lead, and the second person able to provide input and feedback on the development. The second person will need to be able to run the first person's code, verify the main result/results, and write a short response, \emph{i.e.} a review of the first person's work. The second person will be added \emph{after} the proposals are turned in. \textbf{If your project cannot be reviewed by a second person, because of data privacy, computational frameworks, or other reasons, please document this in your proposal write-up}. In this case, you will be the second person on your project, and due to the overlap in content, your individual project grade will be worth correspondingly more by 5 points.

The project you propose should be different from an existing analysis either in the literature or from other class projects of yours. It is permissible to perform an analysis in data that warrants a second analysis. My guideline here is that the analysis must be greater than 50\% new. To get approval for these study, please describe the existing project that highlights the difference and contribution of this class's project, and provide any relevant documents (proposals, manuscripts, and/or citations). If the project has overlap with work from another course, you must also provide documented approval from the other faculty member/research collaborator(s). 

You are free to use programming language(s) of your choosing.

\section{Proposal Details (10 points)}
Please provide information for the following fields. Your proposal write-up should be less than 2 pages.

\subsection{What is your proposed analysis?}


\subsection{Why is your proposed analysis important?}


\subsection{How will your analysis contribute to existing work? Provide references.}


\subsection{Describe the data. Please also define Y outcome(s), U treatment, V covariates, W population as applicable.}


\subsection{What study design, pre-processing, and machine learning methods do you intend to use? Justify that the analysis is of appropriate size for a course project.}


\subsection{What are possibe limitations of the study?}
